# asset-portfolio-visualizer

## What is the app?
Asset Portfolio Visualizer is a very simple Android app that allows the user to input their asset holdings (e.g. 200 shares of Microsoft, etc.) and then see information about their asset portfolio. The purpose is to have it be a very simple way, without having to sign up for anything or give away any personal data, to see information quickly on the assets that you own.  

## How do I run it?

### Method 1
- Open Android Studio

- Click the app

### Method 2
- Open the project files in Android Studio

## Restrictions
- Limited to 25 apk calls per day.
